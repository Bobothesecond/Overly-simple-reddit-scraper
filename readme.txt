This is a simple reddit scraper I made as a test.

The list of subreddits to be scraped is in the subs.txt file. You can append which subs you would like to scrape by writing in the text document in the following formate:
a,b,c,d,e,f,g etc...

when running the script you will be prompted for a number to determine how many posts from each selected subreddit will be scraped.
